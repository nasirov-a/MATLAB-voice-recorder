# MATLAB-voice-recorder
Code will take the name of the speaker as an input and create 13 Recordings with different naming.

All recordings will be saved into the folder named as a speaker (from the input given at the beginning) in the path of Recording.m file.


Duration of the recording is set to 3 seconds,but can be changed by changing 'recordingduration' constant in line 9

Frequency can be changed in line 6

Naming of the recordings can be changed through line 15 and 32. Futhermore, the type of the file can be changed in these lines by changing ".flac" to other externsions.



The code was mainly done for creating a dataset for Speaker Identification Using Pitch and MFCC example on mathworks.
